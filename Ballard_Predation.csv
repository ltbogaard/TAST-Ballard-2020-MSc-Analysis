Comments:
After fixing the initial problem with the 7D Mark II (camera trying to focus but shutter not clicking on the programmed schedule), the camera was initially working, but when I went to check it after Survey 3, it was showing an error message (“the connection between the lens and the camera is faulty, clean the contact”). After disconnecting the lens from the body and cleaning the contact point, it worked for a few more photos, then showed the same error message again, so I did not continue trying to troubleshoot. 

AC took ID photos from the gate using her personal camera. 

The GoPro was set up to take time-lapsed video of the fish ladder. 

Bearings were taken from the platform using a calibrated angle board. Angle board was placed in the NW corner of the platform railing. A calibration was made for the angle board in this position using a compass. All bearings taken from this location will need to be corrected by +20° during post processing."
